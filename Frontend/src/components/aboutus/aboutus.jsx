        <h2>Digital Mapping of Rajasthan's Performing Artist Communities</h2>
        <p>
          This research project aims to map Rajasthan's performing arts communities to bridge the documentation gap, 
          improve information accessibility, and provide inclusive and comprehensive data. Our goal is to develop 
          innovative preservation projects and methodologies, unlocking Rajasthan‚Äôs rich cultural heritage. By doing so, 
          we aim to safeguard and empower Rajasthan's artist communities, ensuring their traditions thrive in the modern era.

        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>
          Rajasthan is renowned for its vibrant performing arts, yet many traditional practices are disappearing, and artist 
          communities face growing challenges. Oral art forms, once deeply embedded in historical social systems, have lost 
          their original functions due to modern shifts, pushing artists toward tourism and commercial entertainment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite the existence of around 45 artist communities, the lack of comprehensive documentation severely hampers 
          preservation efforts. While some groups, like the Kalbeliyas, Langas, and Manganiyars, have received limited scholarly 
          attention, most remain undocumented, making it difficult to develop effective preservation strategies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, no centralized digital platform exists to consolidate and share this knowledge, restricting access for 
          researchers, artists, and cultural enthusiasts. With the last bearers of traditional knowledge fading, urgent action 
          is needed. This research project aims to fill that gap before it is too late.

        <h2>Methodology</h2>
        <p>
          With IIT Jodhpur centrally located in Rajasthan, the project benefits from local and international expert scholars in 
          ethnography and sociology, combined with technical expertise in digitization. Researchers will conduct field research, 
          interviews, and use mapping tools to gather comprehensive data from artist communities across Rajasthan. This data will 
          be digitized and made accessible through a centralized platform.
